Remove uncessary plugins hierarchy: we do not need separate internal gui plugins, can include everything related to ui directly in the game state handler plugin.
Also rename plugins to AppStateNameHandlerPlugin. We will have AppStatePlugin, hadnler plugins, and maybe some other plugins that are used across multiple states.
Also probably rename WsResourceClient/ServerPlugin to just WsClientPlugin, Resource is uncessary - we may have some systems there also. Or remove plugins in general and export resource directly.
Can't parse http body with nested json - can't know type upfront. Probably we can know the body type by header (e.g. if it's login response), and parse it on the application level (inside server_messages_receiver systems) using appropriate schema with Serialize/Deserialize implemented.
